# 🧠 NLP Preprocessing Techniques Repository

Welcome to the **NLP Preprocessing Techniques** repository!  

This repo contains all the essential NLP preprocessing methods and utilities you need to build strong Natural Language Processing pipelines.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) models require clean, well-prepared data. This repository covers fundamental and advanced preprocessing techniques including:

- ✂️ Tokenization  
- 🚫 Stop Words Removal   
- 🌿 Stemming (Porter, Snowball)  
- 📝 Lemmatization   
- 🔢 One-Hot Encoding   
- 📚 Bag of Words   
- 📊 N-Grams   
- 🏷️ POS Tagging   
- 🕵️‍♂️ Named Entity Recognition (NER)   

Each technique includes clear explanations, code examples, and practical use cases.

## 💡 Why Preprocessing?

Preprocessing transforms raw text into a format that NLP models can understand and learn from, improving:

- Model accuracy  
- Training speed  
- Resource efficiency  

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-preprocessing.git

## 📌 Final Notes:

This repository is a curated collection of essential NLP preprocessing techniques designed to build a strong foundation for any Natural Language Processing project. 

Whether you're working on text classification, sentiment analysis, or chatbot development, these building blocks will streamline your workflow and improve model performance.

Stay curious, keep experimenting, and explore how language can be taught to machines! 🧠💡
