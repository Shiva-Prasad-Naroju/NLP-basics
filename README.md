# 🧠 NLP Preprocessing Techniques Repository

Welcome to the **NLP Preprocessing Techniques** repository!  
This repo contains all the essential NLP preprocessing methods and utilities you need to build strong Natural Language Processing pipelines.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) models require clean, well-prepared data. This repository covers fundamental and advanced preprocessing techniques including:

- ✂️ Tokenization  
- 🚫 Stop Words Removal   
- 🌿 Stemming (Porter, Snowball)  
- 📝 Lemmatization   
- 🔢 One-Hot Encoding   
- 📚 Bag of Words   
- 📊 N-Grams   
- 🏷️ POS Tagging   
- 🕵️‍♂️ Named Entity Recognition (NER)   

Each technique includes clear explanations, code examples, and practical use cases.

## 💡 Why Preprocessing?

Preprocessing transforms raw text into a format that NLP models can understand and learn from, improving:

- Model accuracy  
- Training speed  
- Resource efficiency
